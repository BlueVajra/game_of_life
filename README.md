# Cory's 'Conway's Game of Life'

This was my first attempt at recreating the classic Conway's Game of Life. I won't go into details here, but you can find more information at http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway's_Game_of_Life

This was written in JavaScript (with the help of jQuery). While not a difficult project by any means, it is a classic code sample that I hope to improve over time. It has been used by many people to hone their code-craft, explore refactorings and OOP principles. The aim of this project is to do the same.

So please, look through the commits, give me some feedback, let's improve our understanding of programming.

Thanks!
